## **FIND DUPLICATES IN AN ARRAY**
Given an array of N elements that contains elements from 0 to N-1, Any element may occur any number of times. Find the repeating numbers.

#### **Sample Input**
	array = [1, 2, 3, 6, 3, 6, 1], N = 7

#### **Sample Output**
	Output: 1 3 6

#### **Sample Explanation**
Elements 1, 3 and 6 appear twice in the array. Hence they are repeating in nature.

## **Expected Time Complexity**
__O__(N), where N is the size of the array

## **Expected Space Complexity**
__O__(1), i.e., constant space complexity.

## **Constraints**
	1 <= N <= 100000
